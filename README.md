## Key Contributions:

This system revolutionized insurance policy rating by transitioning from error-prone spreadsheets to a robust, automated system. Key technologies I used include **Python, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, FastAPI, Docker**, and various **Google Cloud Platform** services.This foundation also facilitated my subsequent project: automating financial transactions in **QuickBooks**. üí∏

- **Eastridge Workforce Solution**: Played a pivotal role in establishing the initial engineering team for the Mexico office. Beyond recruitment, I received corporate training for the Engineering Manager position and contributed to enhancing various microservices using **Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy**, and **AWS**. üåê

- **DispatchHealth**: Built a **Feature Store** to manage, store, and disseminate features for model building and deployment. This project involved **AWS SageMaker, Prefect** (a workflow orchestration platform), and other tools, handling sensitive patient and medical data in compliance with **HIPAA** regulations. üîí
